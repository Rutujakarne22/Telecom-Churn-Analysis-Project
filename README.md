# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Project
Objective: 

To identify the underlying factors contributing to customer churn, quantify their impact, and provide actionable insights to help the telecom company improve customer retention rates and enhance service quality.

Key Findings:

1.Churn Rate:
26.5% of customers have churned. Senior citizens exhibit a 15-20% higher churn rate.

2.Tenure:
Customers with a tenure of 1-2 months account for over 40% of churned customers, while those with longer tenures have a retention rate exceeding 80%.

3.Contract Type:
Month-to-month contracts show a churn rate of 45%, compared to 11% for 1-year and 8% for 2-year contracts.

4.Service Usage:
Lack of services like OnlineBackup or TechSupport increases churn by 30%.

5.Payment Methods:
Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rate at 42%, compared to credit card (15%) and automatic payments (11%).

Conclusion
This analysis reveals that churn is influenced by a combination of factors, including contract type, service utilization, payment methods, and tenure. Customers on short-term contracts, those who avoid specific value-added services, or those using electronic check payments are more likely to leave.
