# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Project
Objective: 

To identify the underlying factors contributing to customer churn, quantify their impact, and provide actionable insights to help the telecom company improve customer retention rates and enhance service quality.

Conducted an in-depth analysis of customer churn in the telecom industry using Python and data visualization techniques. Identified key factors contributing to churn, such as contract types, payment methods, and service usage patterns. Key findings included a 26.5% churn rate, higher churn among short-tenure customers, and significant retention through long-term contracts. Visualized insights using charts and graphs to highlight actionable strategies, including promoting value-added services and optimizing payment methods. The project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and deriving business insights to improve customer retention.


Conclusion:

This analysis reveals that churn is influenced by a combination of factors, including contract type, service utilization, payment methods, and tenure. Customers on short-term contracts, those who avoid specific value-added services, or those using electronic check payments are more likely to leave.
